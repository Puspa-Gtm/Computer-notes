        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Information Security and Cyber Law have become crucial aspects of modern technology-driven societies. As technology continues to advance and the internet becomes an integral part of everyday life, the risk of cyber threats and security breaches also increases. Protecting digital information from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, and destruction is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring safe online communication. Cyber laws have been established to govern the ethical and legal aspects of technology usage, aiming to protect individuals, organizations, and nations from cybercrime. With rapid digitalization, awareness of information security practices and compliance with cyber laws is more important than ever before.</p>
    
        <h3>What is Information Technology?</h3>
        <p>Information Technology (IT) is the application of computers and telecommunications to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data. IT is the backbone of modern communication and data management, playing a pivotal role in various fields such as education, healthcare, finance, and industry. It has transformed the way we live, work, and interact, enabling real-time information exchange and efficient data processing.</p>
        <p>Social impacts of IT include improved accessibility to information, enhanced communication, remote work opportunities, and efficient service delivery. However, it also poses challenges such as privacy concerns, digital divide, and the rise of cybercrime. Addressing these challenges through secure practices and robust cyber laws is essential to maximizing the benefits of IT.</p>
    
        <h3>Information Security</h3>
        <p>Information security refers to the protection of data and information systems from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information. Cyber attacks, such as hacking, data breaches, and malware infections, pose significant threats to information security, making it crucial to implement preventive measures to safeguard data.</p>
    
        <h3>Cryptography</h3>
        <p>Cryptography is the practice of securing information through encryption, converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the reverse process, converting ciphertext back into plaintext. Cryptography is widely used for secure communications, financial transactions, and data protection, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.</p>
    
        <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
        <p>The Digital Divide refers to the gap between individuals who have access to modern information and communication technology (ICT) and those who do not. This divide often exists between urban and rural areas, developed and developing countries, and among different socioeconomic groups. Bridging the digital divide is essential for promoting inclusive development and equal opportunities.</p>
    
        <h3>Cyber Ethics</h3>
        <p>Cyber ethics refer to moral principles and guidelines governing responsible use of technology and the internet. Adhering to cyber ethics helps prevent cybercrime, protect privacy, and promote respectful online behavior. Key principles of cyber ethics include not using others' passwords, avoiding data theft, refraining from spreading malware, and respecting intellectual property rights.</p>
    
        <h3>Cyber Crime</h3>
    <p>Cyber crime is the act of using computers, networks, or electronic devices to commit illegal activities. It has become more prevalent as technology evolves, posing serious threats to individuals, businesses, and governments. Cyber crimes are typically aimed at stealing information, disrupting services, or damaging digital systems. Some common types of cyber crimes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hacking:</strong> Unauthorized access to computer systems to steal, alter, or destroy data. Hackers exploit system vulnerabilities to gain control or disrupt operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information by impersonating legitimate entities, often through emails or fake websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> Stealing personal information, such as Social Security numbers or credit card details, to commit fraud or other crimes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cyber Stalking:</strong> Using the internet to harass or stalk individuals, often through social media, emails, or other online platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Malware Attacks:</strong> Distributing malicious software like viruses, ransomware, or spyware to infect systems and steal or destroy data.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Overloading a network or server to disrupt service availability, making websites or online services inaccessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential information, often resulting in data theft or exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Online Fraud and Scams:</strong> Deceptive practices conducted over the internet, such as financial scams, investment fraud, and fake online transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Piracy:</strong> Copying, distributing, or using software without proper licensing, violating intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Manipulating people into divulging confidential information by exploiting human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Cyber Law</h3>
        <p>Cyber law is the legal framework established to address issues related to the use of the internet, digital communication, and information systems. It aims to protect users from cybercrime and ensure ethical and lawful use of technology. In Nepal, the Cyber Law was introduced as the Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005, to address cybercrimes and promote secure digital practices.</p>
    
        <h3>IT Policy of Nepal</h3>
        <p>The IT Policy of Nepal outlines strategies to enhance digital literacy, promote IT development, and strengthen cybersecurity measures. It aims to bridge the digital divide, enhance e-governance, and foster an inclusive digital economy by implementing robust information security measures and promoting responsible use of technology. The IT Policy of Nepal outlines the strategic objectives to harness the potential of information technology for national development. The primary objectives are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To declare IT as a high-priority sector and promote its development.</li>
            <li>To establish knowledge-based industries to increase employment opportunities.</li>
            <li>To make public information and service delivery inclusive and effective through e-governance.</li>
            <li>To enhance productivity through the use of IT in social, economic, and business activities.</li>
            <li>To encourage the use of IT in education and training for human resource development.</li>
            <li>To integrate IT into governance for better management and transparency.</li>
            <li>To support and enhance digital literacy and reduce the digital divide.</li>
            <li>To facilitate access to global IT initiatives and innovations.</li>
        </ul>
